# hatch-frontend

This is a Vue.js application built with Vite, TypeScript, Vue Router, and Pinia.

## User Journey

Alex decides to install the Hatch app with his other friends. They all register themselves as a user and add each other as friends. One Saturday morning, Alex heads to the local wetlands for a birding trip. On the app’s home screen, Alex taps “Start Trip" to begin a new session. As he walks along the trail, he spots a Great Blue Heron standing in the shallow waters. Excited, Alex taps the “Log a Bird” button to snap a picture. The photo is then automatically logged to his active trip session. Over the next hour, Alex adds several more sightings. When Alex finishes, he taps “End Session," and the app prompts him to write a caption. Alex types: “A peaceful morning at the wetlands :D". The session is then automatically turned into a post that appears in the feed of Alex’s birding friends and in Alex's profile. Later that afternoon, one of Alex’s friends, Maya, opens the app and sees Alex’s trip post on her home feed. She leaves a comment: “Beautiful shot of the heron!” Another friend adds, “I'm so jealous, I haven't spotted a kingfisher in person myself yet!” Since posting and commenting are limited to friends, Alex feels safe sharing his sightings.
